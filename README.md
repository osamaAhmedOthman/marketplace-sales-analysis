# 🛍️ Marketplace Sales Analysis (EDA Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes marketplace sales data using **Python, Pandas, and Plotly**.  
The goal is to uncover **customer behavior, product performance, regional trends, and payment preferences** to support data-driven business decisions.  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** → Data cleaning & transformation  
- **Plotly & Matplotlib** → Interactive and static visualizations  
- **SciPy** → Hypothesis testing  
- **Missingno** → Data quality checks  

---

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed
1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
   - Removed duplicates & handled missing values  
   - Created new features (Seasons, Revenue Tiers, Price Categories, Order Size, etc.)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Temporal trends (daily, weekly, monthly revenue)  
   - Product category performance  
   - Regional sales analysis  
   - Payment method adoption & efficiency  
   - Price vs. Quantity insights  

3. **Business Insights**  
   - Identified underperforming categories by region  
   - Segmented customers (Budget Shoppers, Premium Buyers, Bulk Buyers)  
   - Profiled high-value transactions  
   - Revenue concentration (Pareto/80-20 analysis)  

4. **Statistical Testing**  
   - ANOVA: Compared mean transaction values across regions & payment methods  
   - Chi-Square: Tested product category preferences across regions

## 🚀 Key Findings
- **Electronics** dominates revenue, while **Books & Clothing** drive transaction volume.  
- **North America** generates the highest revenue, but **Europe** has the highest average transaction value.  
- **Credit Cards** are the most popular payment method, especially in North America.  
- Most purchases are **small (1–2 units)**, but a few bulk or high-value transactions account for the majority of revenue.  
- Seasonal effects: Electronics peak in Q4, while Clothing rises in Spring/Summer.  

---

## 📌 Recommendations
- 📈 **Increase marketing for Electronics in South America** → potential +12% revenue growth.  
- 🎯 **Discount or reposition underperforming categories** (e.g., Books in Asia).  
- 💳 **Promote alternative payment methods** in Asia & Europe for higher adoption.  
- 🔍 Track **KPIs**: Revenue per Region per Month, Category Market Share, and Payment Method Conversion.
